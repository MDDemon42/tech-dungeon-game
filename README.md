# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### To get version of extension:
 - `yarn install`
 - `yarn build`
 - load unpacked `build` folder in `chrome://extensions`

### Comments
 - Had to use `HashRouter` instead of modern `RouterProvider`
 - Had to use both `chrome.storage` and `redux store` to store data
 - Most of images for Tech Dungeon Game is from `heromachine` service.

### Restricts
 - Battle abilities must have either 1 or 3 or 5 targets

 # TODO:
 0) Tests are really hard to implement to this project =(

    
 1) Oversimplifying!!!
