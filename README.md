# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### To get version of extension:
 - `yarn install`
 - `yarn build`
 - load unpacked `build` folder in `chrome://extensions`

### Comments
 - Had to use `HashRouter` instead of modern `RouterProvider`
 - Had to use both `chrome.storage` and `redux store` to store data
 - Most of images for Tech Dungeon Game is from `heromachine` service.

 # TODO:
 1) Add `team` instead of `user`
 2) `Dummy` on `Battle Screen`
 3) Add more abilities to use on `Battle Screen`
 4) Extra `MASPIC`
 5) Make mutual exclusions within `MASPIC`
 6) Fix styles
 7) More ~ abilities ~ to get more user resources (~ battery capacity ~ for cyborg)
 8) Mix `MASPIC` to get `elf`, `orc`, `vampire` and `werewolf`
